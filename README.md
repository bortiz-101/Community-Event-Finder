COMP 425 Final Project. A desktop application for discovering, organizing, and visualizing local events.

## Overview

Students often struggle to track events because information is scattered across flyers, chats, and websites.  
This application solves that by providing a single unified desktop platform that supports:

- Browsing current events
- Map-based exploration
- Favorites tracking
- Distance filtering
- Calendar visualization
- ICS export
- Posting new events
